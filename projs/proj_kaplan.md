# Project Kap
For our inaugural project, we will be redesigning Professor Kaplan's website (which as we've seen, could use a bit of work)!

[Kaplan's Website](https://sfkaplan.people.amherst.edu/)

## Goals
Here's what we will complete by the end of the semester:
- New and unique designs for Prof. Kaplan's website.
- Working websites implementing those designs!
- A **final** presentation of our designs to Prof. Kaplan to receive feedback.

## Guiding Steps
This is a large problem, so as with any software you hope to develop, you must break it down into managable tasks to track progress. Here's a small outline of the *big* steps we'll need take to complete our project.

- Understand what tools we need to know to complete this project.
    - *"I already know how to use all of these tools."* -- Great, we can get to designing and building!
    - *"I don't know one the tools required."* -- That's fine, let's learn it!
- Understand the problem.
    - In our case, *what does a professor (Kaplan) need to display* (better question: what does a student of his need to see)? Some of these things might include a syllabus, weekly notes, assignments, resources, and course or contact information.
    - *What's the easiest way to view all this information?* Try out different layouts and test them. Find out what others think about them.
    - Can we make it nice to look at? Pick some nice colors and fonts and build a brand (or in this case, course) identity.
- Implement the functionality with web technologies:
    - HTML to layout the content.
    - CSS to style and visually organize it.
    - JavaScript to add more advanced functionality.
    - Later as we develop more complex projects, we'll start to need a more modular way of writing and handling code.

## Structure
We will work in `duos`. Here is a list of the existing duos: [Duo Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KivvmAnCGMQg1-LxoX03eFUMOYbwRfC_Dc9rvw-aQxQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Each duo will come up with a design and build it to completion. I suggest working collaboratively with something like GitHub. You can also practice a technique known as "pair-programming" in which one person code while the other navigates the programmer to ensure they are writing correct code.

You may find it easy to assign roles to each member based on individual skills, but I encourage duos to also switch roles around. Get uncomfortable by trying out a new role that you're not as skilled in. Take this chance to learn something while completing a project!
