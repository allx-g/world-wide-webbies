# 3W: World Wide Webbies
*The brand-new web development team at Amherst College!*
## Hello World!
—and welcome to the 3W group! By becoming part of this team, you have earned the title of “Webby” (not to be confused with The Webby Awards™). How exciting!

The purpose of this group is to give web development enthusiasts like **you** a place to explore and learn as much as you can about the subject with the support of other enthusiasts and myself.

But first, I want to clarify the meaning of “web development.” The word “development” may lead you to think this is a solely coding-based project group focused on the technical development of web applications. But that is only a narrow slice of the full discipline, and as an exploratory project group, there’s no need for it to be that way. So, by “web development,” I’m talking about the entire process of creating a web application that encompasses everything from:

- researching the interested “client”
- understanding the problem to solve
- designing an accessible and effective user interface
- implementing said interface (front-end)
- processing user data (back-end)
- project management
- communicating your solution (web app) to others
- receiving feedback for continual improvement

These things make up what it truly means to develop on the Web, and this club is your chance to dive into as much of it as you would like. And what better way to do that than with the support of other like-minded people?

With all that said: *let's get to developing!*

*[Below is some extra logistical information]*

## Meeting Time

The plan is to meet weekly as a group. You can, of course, come to all meetings or whichever ones work best for you. Use this time for yourself to dive deep into web development!

- *When?* `7-8pm EST`on `Mondays` for an hour.
- *Where?* in `SCCE C209`.

### Activities

Meetings will look something like one of these two templates:

**Learning and Development**

For the first 30 mins, we will learn some new concept (e.g. basic web layout with CSS Grid).

Following that, we will spend the rest of our time together actively working on a small project with randomly assigned teammates.

**Presentation and Exploration**

We will have larger projects that we will work towards over the semester. These will be times devoted to showing off our progress to other members and receiving constructive feedback on how to further expand our projects.

This could take 20-30 minutes which we will then follow with more casual work time and *snacks!*
